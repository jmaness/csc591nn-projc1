Readme file for Project C1 (Team 5):

1)  We have provided two notebooks.  One contains code related to our
    primary model - SVM.  The other contains code for our secondary
    model - DNN.    

2)  Each notebook has been saved with results, so you can view what they
    produced without running.  WARNING:  Running either notebook will take
    hours.
