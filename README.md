# Project C - Team 5


1)  We have provided two notebooks.

* `c2.ipynb` - One contains code related to our primary model based on VGG16 and a custom classifier.
* `extra_credit.ipynb` - Classification using ExtraCredit-Train and ExtraCredit-Test weather data.

2)  Each notebook has been saved with results, so you can view what they
    produced without running.  WARNING:  Running either notebook will take
    hours.
